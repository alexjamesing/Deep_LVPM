Welcome to Deep LVPM's documentation!
=====================================

Deep Latent Variable Path Modelling (DLVPM) is a method for multi‑view data integration using deep learning.  It constructs orthogonal latent variables that maximize correlation between different types of data and uses an explicit structural path matrix to define relationships between these latent factors. This documentation provides an overview of the DLVPM toolbox, installation instructions, step‑by‑step tutorials, and reference information about the core classes and layers.
